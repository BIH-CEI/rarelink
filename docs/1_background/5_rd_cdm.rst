Rare Disease Common Data Model v2.0
===================================

The Rare Diseases Common Data Model (RD CDM) v2.0 was developed to address
the complexity and variability inherent in rare diseases, which number over
6,000 and often require unique approaches to research and clinical care. This
model is based on the Common Data Elements (CDEs) from the European Rare
Disease Registry Infrastructure (ERDRI-CDS), providing a standardized structure
for data capture and analysis. We expanded on these elements to meet the
needs of international interoperability standards, aligning with both HL7 FHIR
and the GA4GH Phenopacket Schema. The development of this model
involved overcoming challenges such as the lack of standardized terms for
disease characteristics and the need to represent highly variable clinical data
across different rare diseases.

.. note::
   The RD CDM v2.0 is not a balloted version, but it can serve as a template for
   future standardization efforts in rare disease research.

Key Success Factors of a Rare Disease Common Data Model
-------------------------------------------------------

Developing an RD CDM also requires balancing between complexity and
usability. A successful model must be comprehensive enough to capture the
nuances of each rare disease, yet simple enough to be adopted across various
healthcare systems. One key difficulty is finding a common denominator for the
unique clinical requirements of diverse rare diseases while maintaining
flexibility for future expansions. Additionally, ensuring that the data can be
seamlessly integrated into existing healthcare systems without exceeding the 
avaliable resources is also essential. Addressing these complexities, the 
RD CDM v2.0 provides a framework that enhances the consistency of rare disease 
data, enabling better comparative analysis across research institutions and 
healthcare settings. While the RD CDM v2.0 is not a balloted version, it can 
serve as a template for future standardization efforts in rare disease research.

Key success factors for the RD CDM include its ability to support secondary
uses of data, such as transferring data to central registries or enabling
federated analyses. By adhering to international interoperability standards, the
model ensures that data captured locally can be reused in broader contexts,
such as global research initiatives. This not only improves the efficiency of 
rare disease research but also helps preserve the unique aspects of each 
condition. The RD CDM's flexibility allows it to evolve with the growing needs 
of the rare disease community.
