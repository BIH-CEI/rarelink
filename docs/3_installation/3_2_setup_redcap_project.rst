    BioPortal ontology service.
2. Name your REDCap project, e.g.: 
    - ``RareLink - NameofyourInstitution`` or 
    - ``RareLink - NameofyourProject``.
3. Let your institutional account be added and given API access for the project.
4. Follow the instructions given to you by your **REDCap administator** to 
   further set up your project.
5. Copy the API token for the project and keep it secure.

.. note:: 
    Be aware of the REDCap **development and production mode**. 
    Read the :ref:`1_6` section and discuss this with your REDCap administrator!

    BioPortal must be connected to your REDCap instance to use the ontology
    service. If you cannot see this option in your REDCap setup, contact your
    REDCap administrator.
