RareLink Framework
==================

In this section we elaborate on the development of the RareLink framework, how 
it is designed to facilitate the management of rare disease data, and how it
supports the creation of interoperable and reusable datasets. We provide an
overview of the different components of the RareLink framework, including the
native REDCap sheets, the entire project set up, the supported ontologies, the 
GA4GH Phenopacket Schema and the HL7 FHIR standard.
