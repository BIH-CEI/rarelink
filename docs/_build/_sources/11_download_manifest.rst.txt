Downloads Manifest
====================


The downloads manifest contains links to all downloadable files in the RareLink 
framework. Use this as the central source of truth for file downloads. Each file
entry includes the version, file name, and URL.

- **Manifest File**: The manifest is hosted at `_static/downloads_manifest.json`:
  :download:`View Downloads Manifest <_static/downloads_manifest.json>`



.. note::
    The manifest is dynamically fetched by the RareLink CLI, allowing automated
    versioning and URL updates. To learn more, visit the :ref:`2_3`.
