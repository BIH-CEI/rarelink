General Information (please read!)
-------------------------------------

This section provides general information about the manual data capture
process:

- **Purpose**: The manual data capture guide is designed to facilitate the
  entry of patient data into the :ref:`2_2`. It provides detailed instructions
  for completing each section of the RareLink CDM forms.
- **Feedback**: If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving
  the manual data capture process, please find more information in the :ref:`7`
  section or `write a GitHub issue <https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rarelink/issues>`_.
  RareLink is a collaborative effort, and we welcome your feedback.
- **ERDRI-CDS**: The European Registry Registration requires specific fields to 
  be completed. You can find the `ERDRI-CDS here <https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/system/files/public/CDS/EU_RD_Platform_CDS_Final.pdf>`_ 
  and the corresponding fields in the RareLink-CDM marked with ``ERDRI-CDS`` 
  in the guide.
- **Data Security**: Ensure your local REDCap project is set up, and everything
  is sorted with your local REDCap administrator. When capturing real patient
  data, ensure that the REDCap project is in **Production Mode**! Read the 
  :ref:`1_6`-Background section for more information and discuss this with your
  local REDCap administrator.
- **Searching Terminologies with** `BioPortal <https://bioportal.bioontology.org/>`_: 
  Many RareLink sheets feature integrated BioPortal search functionality.
  When searching, consider using synonyms or abbreviations, as these are also 
  indexed in BioPortal. If you cannot find the desired term, try searching for 
  broader or related terms. Alternatively, use the 
  `OLS Platform <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies>`_ to identify the 
  correct code and display for the concept you are looking for.
- **Updates**: This section will continue to evolve as RareLink documentation 
  expands. Please  check the :ref:`6` and :ref:`7` sections for updates and 
  additional information.

Types of Fields: 
""""""""""""""""""

- **Mandatory Fields** ``*``: Mandatory fields are marked within this guide with a red
  asterisk (``*``). Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed before saving
  the form.
- **Optional Fields**: Fields that are not mandatory can be left blank if the 
  information is unknown or not required. This flexibility allows for partial 
  data entry while maintaining focus on required fields.

_________________________________________________________________________________

Types of Instruments:
"""""""""""""""""""""""

+-----------------------+
| **Single-Entry Form** |
+-----------------------+ 

--> These forms are designed for one-time data entry and capture information that 
is not expected to change over time, but can be re-edited if necessary.

+-------------------+
| **Repeated Form** |
+-------------------+

--> These forms are designed for capturing information that may change over time, 
such as patient status, care pathway, and disease 
history. You can repeat these forms to reflect changes over time.

- If you are within the form, you can use the **"Save and Add New Instance"**
  at the end of the sheet button to create a new instance of the form directly.
- Alternatively when viewing the individual record, you can click the
  **"+" button next to the form name**. This action will create a new instance
  of the form, allowing you to capture additional data points for the same 
  individual.

  unknown or not required .Fill in all other fields about the variant, 
  depending on the information available and your current use case. It is a
  **repeated** form; you can enter as many variants as needed.

    if applicable, also to the **5.1 Disease**. 
  - You can also link multiple variants to a single disease 
    by repeating the form!

- **6.1.2 Progress Status of interpretaion**: required when creating GA4GH 
  Phenopackets - You can find the exact definitions here: `GA4GH ProgressStatus <https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interpretation.html#rstprogressstatus>`_ 
- **6.1.3 Interpretation Status**: required when creating GA4GH Phenopackets -
  you can find the exact definitions here: `GA4GH InterpretationStatus <https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genomic-interpretation.html#rstinterpretationstatus>`_

  unsure how to validate, enter all information in this field.
- **6.1.7 - 6.1.9 Variant Expression [HGVS]** (``ERDRI-CDS``): Please select 
  the appropriate HGVS nomenclature for the variant. 

  > **If you are unsure, prioritize** ``c.HGVS``.

    - Provide validated HGVS values (`HGVS Nomenclature <https://hgvs-
      nomenclature.org/stable/>`_) for genomic (g.HGVS), DNA (c.HGVS), or
      protein (p.HGVS) changes.
    - If the variant is not validated or you are unsure how to validate, enter 
      all information in the **6.1.6 Genetic Mutation String** field.

- **HGVS Validation**: 

    1. Validate mutations using `ClinVar <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/>`_
       or `Varsome <https://varsome.com/>`_
    2. Confirm the expression with the `HGVS Validator <https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/hgvs-validator/>`_.
    3. If the validation fails, enter the details in the **6.1.6 Genetic Mutation String** field.
    4. ``*``: **Are you sure the entered HGVS expression was validated using 
       the variant validator?** - this field is mandatory to ensure the
       validation status.

  Phenopackets - you can find the exact definitions here: `GA4GH TherapeuticActionability <https://phenopacket-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/variant-interpretation.html#rsttherapeuticactionability>`_

.. attention::
    The quality of the variant's validated HGVS expression is crucial for the 
    correct interpretation of the genetic findings and creation of GA4GH 
    Phenopackets. If you are unsure about the validation, enter all information
    in the **6.1.6 Genetic Mutation String** field and consult a geneticist.
