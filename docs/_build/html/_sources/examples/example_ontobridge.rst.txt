Complete Example: Import of retrospective data
==============================================

This example demonstrates how to use the `Phenopacket Mapper` class to map any data base to our RareLink data 
structure and subsequently generate data that can be uploaded to a local REDCap project.

The processed data can then be exported to GA4GH Phenopackets using the Phenopacket Mapper module 
or FHIR resources using the toFHIR module.
