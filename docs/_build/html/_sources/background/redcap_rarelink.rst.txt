REDCap and RareLink Framework
=============================

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a web- and survey-based application 
designed to capture data and create databases and projects for clinical research
by the Vanderbuilt University. As an open-source tool, REDCap has gained 
widespread adoption across university hospitals, research institutes, and other 
healthcare institutions due to its flexibility and cost-free availability. One 
of the primary advantages of REDCap is its ability to be hosted locally within 
the clinical information system of a hospital. This ensures that sensitive data 
captured through REDCap remains within the hospital’s infrastructure, enhancing 
data privacy and security.

Although REDCap provides a highly flexible environment for data collection, it 
does not natively define or enforce standardized variables. This lack of native 
definitions for variables can lead to inconsistencies in data capture across 
different projects and institutions, potentially hindering data exchange and 
interoperability. To address these issues, a wide range of modules and add-ons 
have been designed and developed, allowing users to extend REDCap's 
functionality and tailor it to specific research needs. The REDCap API also 
allows for seamless integration with external systems, enabling automated data 
transfers and further enhancing the platform’s utility in research environments.

RareLink maximizes the utility of REDCap by providing a comprehensive framework 
designed specifically for rare disease (RD) research and care. At the core of 
RareLink is the Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD CDM), which integrates 
pre-configured REDCap sheets, instruments, and project setups. This framework 
ensures that data capture is both consistent and compliant with international 
standards, such as HL7 FHIR and GA4GH Phenopackets, without the need for 
additional coding or mapping. As a result, RareLink allows researchers and 
clinicians to collect and process rare disease data seamlessly within the REDCap 
environment.

By embedding standardized data collection instruments and native data processing 
pipelines, RareLink addresses one of the primary limitations of REDCap—its lack 
of native variable definitions. With RareLink, data can be captured, processed, 
and exported in interoperable formats suitable for rare disease registries and 
healthcare information systems. The integration of FHIR resources and 
Phenopackets enables rare disease data to be shared across institutions, 
facilitating collaboration and improving the potential for meaningful research 
and clinical advancements in RD care.

RareLink enhances the functionality of REDCap by transforming it into a powerful 
tool for rare disease data management. By leveraging the REDCap API and built-in 
tools, RareLink ensures that the data captured in REDCap can be seamlessly 
integrated into broader research ecosystems, maximizing its utility and 
interoperability for rare disease research and patient care.
