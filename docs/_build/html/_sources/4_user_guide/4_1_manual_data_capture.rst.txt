Manual Data Capture Guide
==========================

.. hint::
    This section offers detailed guidance for manually entering data into
    RareLink CDM forms:
    
    - For more information about the RareLink CDM, visit :ref:`2_2`. 

    - Instructions for installing the RareLink CDM instruments in REDCap are available at :ref:`3_1`.


General Information (please read!)
-------------------------------------

This section provides general information about the manual data capture
process:

- **Purpose**: The manual data capture guide is designed to facilitate the
  entry of patient data into the :ref:`2_2`. It provides detailed instructions
  for completing each section of the RareLink CDM forms.
- **Feedback**: If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving
  the manual data capture process, please find more information in the :ref:`7`
  section or `write a GitHub issue <https://github.com/BIH-CEI/rarelink/issues>`_.
  RareLink is a collaborative effort, and we welcome your feedback.
- **Data Security**: Ensure your local REDCap project is set up, and everything
  is sorted with your local REDCap administrator. When capturing real patient
  data, ensure that the REDCap project is in **Production Mode**! Read the 
  :ref:`1_6`-Background section for more information and discuss this with your
  local REDCap administrator.
- **Searching Terminologies with** `BioPortal <https://bioportal.bioontology.org/>`_: 
  Many RareLink sheets feature integrated BioPortal search functionality.
  When searching, consider using synonyms or abbreviations, as these are also 
  indexed in BioPortal. If you cannot find the desired term, try searching for 
  broader or related terms. Alternatively, use the 
  `OLS Platform <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies>`_ to identify the 
  correct code and display for the concept you are looking for.
- **Updates**: This section will continue to evolve as RareLink documentation 
  expands. Please  check the :ref:`6` and :ref:`7` sections for updates and 
  additional information.

Types of Fields: 
""""""""""""""""""
- **Mandatory Fields** ``*``: Mandatory fields are marked within this guide with a red
  asterisk (``*``). Ensure that all mandatory fields are completed before saving
  the form.
- **Optional Fields**: Fields that are not mandatory can be left blank if the 
  information is unknown or not required. This flexibility allows for partial 
  data entry while maintaining focus on required fields.

Types of Instruments:
"""""""""""""""""""""""

+-----------------------+
| **Single-Entry Form** |
+-----------------------+ 

--> These forms are designed for one-time data entry and capture information that 
is not expected to change over time, but can be re-edited if necessary.

+-------------------+
| **Repeated Form** |
+-------------------+

--> These forms are designed for capturing information that may change over time, 
such as patient status, care pathway, and disease 
history. You can repeat these forms to reflect changes over time.

- If you are within the form, you can use the **"Save and Add New Instance"**
  at the end of the sheet button to create a new instance of the form directly.
- Alternatively when viewing the individual record, you can click the
  **"+" button next to the form name**. This action will create a new instance
  of the form, allowing you to capture additional data points for the same 
  individual.

----------------------

+-------------------+
| **Repeated Form** |
+-------------------+

.. hint::
    If you have difficlties finding the rare disease, use the `OLS Platform <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies>`_ for
    ontology-specific searches, for example the `OLS-MONDO Search <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/mondo>`_ 

This section provides details about diseases:

- It is a **repeated** form; you can enter as many diseases as you wish with one
  disease per form

  using *MONDO* to encode a disease.

    - To link a disease to genetic variant(s) in Section **6.1 Genetic Findings**,
      enter the same *MONDO* or *OMIM_p* codes here. (*OMIM_g* codes refer to genes,
      while *OMIM_p* codes refer to phenotypes (see `OMIM <https://www.omim.org/>`_).)
    - The **ICD-11** is not integrated into BioPortal; use the `ICD-11 Browser
      <https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en>`_ for codes like `AA10`.
- If information for a specific field is not known, leave it blank.

    If you have difficlties finding concepts, use the `OLS Platform <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies>`_ for
    ontology-specific search!

This section provides details about genetic findings:

- **Note:** Fields that are not mandatory can be left blank if the information is
  unknown or not required .Fill in all other fields about the variant, 
  depending on the information available and your current use case. It is a
  **repeated** form; you can enter as many variants as needed.
- **6.1.1 Genomic Diagnosis**: To link a variant to a genetic diagnosis, 
  select the corresponding disease, if applicable, also to the **5.1 Disease**. 
  You can also link multiple variants to a single disease by repeating the form!
- **HGVS Variant Expression**: Please select the appropriate HGVS nomenclature
  for the variant. 

  > **If you are unsure, prioritize** ``c.HGVS``.

    - Provide validated HGVS values (`HGVS Nomenclature <https://hgvs-
      nomenclature.org/stable/>`_) for genomic (g.HGVS), DNA (c.HGVS), or
      protein (p.HGVS) changes.
    - If the variant is not validated or you are unsure how to validate, enter 
      all information in the **6.1.6 Genetic Mutation String** field.

- **HGVS Validation**: 
    1. Validate mutations using `ClinVar <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/>`_
       or `Varsome <https://varsome.com/>`_
    2. Confirm the expression with the `HGVS Validator <https://lhcforms.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/hgvs-validator/>`_.
    3. If the validation fails, enter the details in the **6.1.6 Genetic Mutation String** field.
    4. ``*``: **Are you sure the entered HGVS expression was validated using 
       the variant validator?** - this field is mandatory to ensure the
       validation status.
- **6.1.2 Progress Status of Interpretation**: recommended when creating GA4GH Phenopackets.
- **6.1.3 Interpretation Status**: recommended when creating GA4GH Phenopackets.

- Phenopacket Value Sets:
  - Progress Status: ga4gh_unknown_progress, No information is available about the diagnosis | ga4gh_in_progress, No diagnosis has been found to date but additional differential diagnostic work is in progress. | ga4gh_completed, The work on the interpretation is complete. | ga4gh_solved, The interpretation is complete and also considered to be a definitive diagnosis | ga4gh_unsolved, The interpretation is complete but no definitive diagnosis was found
  - Interpretation Status: ga4gh_unknown_status, No information is available about the status | ga4gh_rejected, The variant or gene reported here is interpreted not to be related to the diagnosis | ga4gh_candidate, The variant or gene reported here is interpreted to possibly be related to the diagnosis | ga4gh_contributory, The variant or gene reported here is interpreted to be related to the diagnosis | ga4gh_causative, The variant or gene reported here is interpreted to be causative of the diagnosis
  - Therapeutic Actionability: ga4gh_unknown_actionability, There is not enough information at this time to support any therapeutic actionability for this variant | ga4gh_not_actionable, This variant has no therapeutic actionability. | ga4gh_actionable, This variant is known to be therapeutically actionable.

.. attention::
    The quality of the variant's validated HGVS expression is crucial for the 
    correct interpretation of the genetic findings and creation of GA4GH 
    Phenopackets. If you are unsure about the validation, enter all information
    in the **6.1.6 Genetic Mutation String** field and consult a geneticist.
