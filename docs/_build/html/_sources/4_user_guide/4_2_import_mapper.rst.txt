Semi-Automatic Data Capture
===========================

.. warning:: 
   RareLink v2.0.0 is under development. Please :ref:`12` us before using
   it to ensure you have the latest updates and guidance.


While there are many existing data bases in rare disease centres and hospitals, 
the data is often not in a structured format. As the RareLink-CDM is a modeled 
with LinkML, there are tools to convert existing data into a LinkML schema.
While we currently have not implemented a full conversion tool, we are happy 
to assist you in converting your data into a LinkML schema.

Although the semi-automation can speed up the process of capturing existing data
bases, the semantic mapping will still have to be done by you.
The semantic mapping and encoding of all data elements and value sets 
to :ref:`1_2` and validating genetic mutations with HGVS is a crucial step
in the process of converting data into the RareLink-CDM format for 
Phenopackets of FHIR export. 


RareLink-CDM LinkML
-------------------

In this seciton :ref:`rarelink_cdm_linkml` we elaborate on the development of the
RareLink-CDM LinkML schema, how it is designed and where it can be found. 
This schema is the basis for REDCap data to be converted to and validated 
against when running ``rarelink redcap export-records``. It was designed to be
light-weight and as close as possible to the original REDCap data model so that
other REDCap projects can also use the :ref:`rarelink-phenopacket-module`.


LinkML schema-automator
------------------------
The LinkML schema-automator is a toolkit that assists with generating and 
enhancing schemas and data models from a variety of sources. The primary end 
target is a LinkML schema, but the framework can be used to generate 
JSON-Schema, SHACL, SQL DDL etc via the LinkML Generator framework. All 
functionality is available via a cli. The functionality is also available 
by using the relevant Python Packages.
