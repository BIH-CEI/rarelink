Semi-Automatic Data Capture of Existing Databases
==================================================

While there are many existing data bases in rare disease centres and hospitals, the data is often not in a structured format. 
RareLink provides a semi-automatic data capture configuration using OntoBridge that allows users to capture data from existing 
databases and convert it into a structured format. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and can be used by non-technical users.
The tool can be used to capture data from multiple sources and convert it into a structured format that can be used for analysis and research.
