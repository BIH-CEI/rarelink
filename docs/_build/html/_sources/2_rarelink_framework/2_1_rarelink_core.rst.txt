RareLink Overview
==================

RareLink aims to maximise the utility of REDCap by providing a comprehensive 
framework designed specifically for rare disease (RD) research and care. 
At the core of RareLink is this documentation, the RareLink instruments that are 
based on the Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD-CDM), its user guides and the 
surrounding preconfigured pipelines and software architecture. This framework 
ensures that data capture is both consistent and compliant with HL7 FHIR and 
GA4GH Phenopackets, without the need for additional coding or mapping. 
As a result, RareLink allows researchers and clinicians to collect and process
rare disease data seamlessly within the REDCap environment.

- Retrospective (tabular) Databases: 
    in many Rare Disease specialised centres, registries or hospitals, data is 
    stored in tabular databases (e.g. Excel). RareLink's Import Mapper that is 
    (based on the API of the Phenopacket Mapper) can be used to convert and 
    import data from these databases into the REDCap RareLink format and your
    local REDCap project.
- Prospective Rare Disease Data Collection: 
    RareLink provides a preconfigured data collection sheets based on the RD-CDM
    and user guides for manual data capture to ensure precision and correctness
    of data captures. Further, RareLink defines guidelines for developing more 
    specialised REDCap sheets around the RD-CDM so that the data captured can 
    also be processed by our framework to generate FHIR resources and Phenopackets. 
- Local REDCap Project and API: 
    - HERE you can find more information on how to create a local REDCap instance 
    in your institution, a new project, or activate your local API. 

    - HERE you can find more information on how to set up the RareLink API in 
    your local REDCap project.

- RareLink & toFHIR: 
    RareLink utilises toFHIR from SRDC to convert the data captured
    in REDCap into FHIR resources. The RD-CDM and the corresponding RareLink
    instruments are preconfigured within our GitHub repository to generate 
    International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR resources and FHIR v4.0.1 resources
    automatically. HERE you can find more information on how to set up the 
    RareLink API and toFHIR module in your local REDCap project to generate 
    FHIR resources.

- RareLink & Phenopackets: 
    RareLink utilises the Phenopacket Mapper to convert the data captured in
    REDCap into Phenopackets. The RD-CDM and the corresponding RareLink
    instruments are preconfigured within our GitHub repository to generate
    Phenopackets automatically.
