RareLink-CDM
=============================

.. warning:: 
    RareLink v2.0.0 is currently under development, and many things are 
    subject to change. Please reach out before implementing or using the 
    software to ensure you have the latest updates and guidance.

In this section, we provide an overview of the instruments that are part of the
RareLink Common Data Model (CDM), which is based on the :ref:`1_5`. 
We have implemented the :ref:`1_5`'s definitions, codes, and mappins 
into the REDCap instruments by encoding the variables and value sets in the
REDCap data dictionary. Each section of the model corresponds to a distinct
instrument, ensuring consistency and comprehensive data capture.

.. hint:: 
    - Read the :ref:`1_6` page to understand how REDCap instruments data dictionaries work.
    - Read the :ref:`1_5` page for more information on the Rare Disease Common Data Model.

RuleSet for Codes and Codesystems
__________________________________
REDCap variables and choice codes have specific limitations and requirements:

- REDCap recommends a maximum of 26 characters for variable names. We have shortened the variable names to adhere to this limitation.
- REDCap variables must be unique and must not contain spaces or special characters, i.e. only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- REDCap choice codes must be unique and must not contain spaces or special characters, i.e. only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

To address these, we have defined a set of rules for the REDCap variables and
choice codes in the RareLink CDM Data Dictionary. The rules are as follows:

1) The REDCap variable names are based on the :ref:`1_5` codes and display names.
2) The REDCap choices are based on the :ref:`1_5` codes and display names.
3) The REDCap variable names are shortened to adhere to the 26-character limit.
4) The REDCap variable names are unique and do not contain spaces or special characters.
5) The REDCap choice codes are unique and do not contain spaces or special characters.
6) All codes begin with the official codesystem prefix (e.g. HP, SNOMED, etc.) as a lower case string followed by an underscore and the code.
7) All codes are defined in the Field Annotations of each data element.

Field Annotations
_________________

Witin the Field Annotation field of each REDCap element, we have defined each 
element's metadata according to the :ref:`1_5` standard, including the following:

- **Variable**: Corresponding to the data element code, codesystem, and display name.
- **Choices**: If applicable, the corresponding choices codesystem, and display name.
- **Version(s)**: If applicable, the corresponding codesystem versions used in the REDCap data element
- **Mapping**: If applicable, the corresponding mapping to the :ref:`1_4` or :ref:`1_3` standard.

Example Field Annotation of 6.2.6 Temporal Pattern:

RareLink CDM Instruments
------------------------

The RareLink CDM instruments are based on the :ref:`1_5` and are designed to
capture the data elements of the RD-CDM. Each instrument corresponds to a
section of the model, ensuring consistency and comprehensive data capture.
