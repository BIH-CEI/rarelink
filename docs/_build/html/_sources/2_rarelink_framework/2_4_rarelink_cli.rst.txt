RareLink CLI
=============

.. warning:: 
    RareLink v2.0.2 is currently under development, and many things are 
    subject to change. Please reach out before implementing or using the 
    software to ensure you have the latest updates and guidance.

The RareLink Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that allows you to interact

to set up and manage the RareLink framework, as well as to interact with the 
data stored in the framework. The CLI is designed to be user-friendly and
intuitive, and it provides a simple and efficient way to work with the RareLink
framework.
