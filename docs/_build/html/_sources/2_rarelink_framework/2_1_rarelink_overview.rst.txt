RareLink Overview
=================

.. warning:: 
   RareLink v2.0.0 is under development. Please :ref:`12` us before using
   it to ensure you have the latest updates and guidance.

RareLink aims to maximise the utility of REDCap by providing a comprehensive 
framework designed specifically for rare disease (RD) research and care. 
At the core of RareLink is this documentation, the RareLink instruments that are 
based on the :ref:`1_5`, its user guides and the 
surrounding preconfigured pipelines and software architecture. This framework 
ensures that data capture is both consistent and compliant with HL7 FHIR and 
GA4GH Phenopackets, without the need for additional coding or mapping. 
As a result, RareLink allows researchers and clinicians to collect and process
rare disease data seamlessly within the REDCap environment.

.. note:: 
    You will need your own REDCap instance to deploy the RareLink framework.
    See the :ref:`3_2` for more information.

RareLink Framework components

_____________________________________________________________________________________

Semi-Automatic Import
______________________
    In many Rare Disease specialised centres, registries or hospitals, data is 
    stored in tabular databases (e.g. Excel). RareLink's Import Mapper that is 
    utilising the `Phenopacket Mapper <https://bih-cei.github.io/phenopacket_mapper/latest/index.html>`_ 
    API can be used to convert and import data from these databases into the 
    REDCap RareLink format and your local REDCap project.

Manual Data Capture
___________________
    RareLink provides a preconfigured data collection sheets based on the :ref:`1_5`
    and user guides for manual data capture to ensure precision and correctness
    of data captured. Further, RareLink defines guidelines for developing more 
    specialised REDCap sheets around the RD-CDM so that the data captured can 
    also be processed by our framework to generate FHIR resources and Phenopackets.

Local REDCap Project Setup and API
__________________________________
    RareLink is designed to be deployed and installed in a local REDCap instance. 
    Using the guidelines provided, or using our preconfigured RareLink-REDCap and 
    setting up the RareLink API, you can ensure that the data captured is compliant
    with the our framework to generate FHIR resources and Phenopackets.

RareLink & toFHIR
__________________
    RareLink utilises toFHIR from SRDC to convert the data captured
    in REDCap into FHIR resources. The RD-CDM and the corresponding RareLink
    instruments are preconfigured within our GitHub repository to generate 
    International Patient Summary (IPS) FHIR resources and FHIR v4.0.1 resources
    automatically. HERE you can find more information on how to set up the 
    RareLink API and toFHIR module in your local REDCap project to generate 
    FHIR resources.

RareLink & Phenopackets
_______________________
    RareLink utilises the Phenopacket Mapper to convert the data captured in
    REDCap into Phenopackets. The RD-CDM and the corresponding RareLink
    instruments are preconfigured within our GitHub repository to generate
    Phenopackets automatically.
