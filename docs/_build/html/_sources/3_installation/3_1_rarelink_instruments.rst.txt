RareLink CDM Instruments
============================

The RareLink REDCap Instruments are a collection of REDCap instruments designed 
to implement the `Rare Disease Common Data Model (RD CDM) <rd_cdm.rst>`_ within 
REDCap. These instruments mirror the exact structure of the RD CDM, which is 
based on the ERDRI-CDS standard. Each section of the model corresponds to a 
distinct instrument, ensuring consistency and comprehensive data capture.

- `1. Formal Criteria <#formal-criteria>`_
- `2. Personal Information <#personal-information>`_
- `3. Patient Status <#patient-status>`_
- `4. Care Pathway <#care-pathway>`_
- `5. Disease <#disease>`_
- `6.1 Genetic Findings <#genetic-findings>`_
- `6.2 Phenotypic Features <#phenotypic-features>`_
- `6.3 Family History <#family-history>`_
- `7. Consent <#consent>`_
- `8. Disability <#disability>`_

In the following, we will describe the structure of each instrument and the 
fields that are included in each one. Specifically, we will describe how the 
implementation of the RD CDM in REDCap is structured and how the data variables 
are organized in each instrument. The instruments are designed to be used in a 
REDCap project. To adhere to REDCap's limitations on variable names and field 
types, we have made some modifications to the original RD CDM. These 
modifications are described in the following sections.

  REDCap recommends a maximum of 26 characters for variable names. We have 
  shortened the variable names to adhere to this limitation.
