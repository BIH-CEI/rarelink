Rare Diseases and Interoperability
===================================

Rare diseases (RDs), though individually rare, collectively impact a significant
global population, estimated to exceed 260 million people. These diseases are 
often characterised by their genetic origins, with over 70% having a suspected 
genetic basis. In Europe, a disease is classified as rare if it affects fewer 
than 5 in 10,000 individuals, which highlights the challenge of addressing the 
medical needs of over 17 million people across the continent. Despite the large 
number of individuals affected, RDs are frequently overlooked in medical 
research and care, largely due to the scarcity of available data and resources.

Interoperability plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges. It ensures
that clinical data can be shared and understood across systems, which is 
especially important in rare disease research. Many healthcare institutions 
lack standardized approaches to data collection and storage, which leads to 
inconsistencies and makes data exchange difficult. Without the use of 
internationally recognized ontologies and coding systems, the data collected 
cannot be efficiently reused or analyzed for further research. Interoperability 
frameworks, such as RareLink, address this issue by facilitating the seamless 
exchange of standardized medical data, thus promoting research and care for 
RD patients.

RareLink, for example, is an interoperability framework embedded in REDCap, 
for RD registries and research. By leveraging international standards such as 
HL7 FHIR and GA4GH Phenopackets, RareLink ensures that data collected can be 
reused not only locally but also globally. This interoperability allows 
researchers to connect with other databases and centers, enhancing the potential
for collaborative research and the development of novel treatments. Furthermore,
the inclusion of ontology codes enables precise bioinformatic analysis, which is
critical given the limited number of patients and data points available in RD 
research.

Ultimately, the success of rare disease research depends heavily on the ability 
to connect and compare data from different sources. The development and 
implementation of frameworks like RareLink enable more efficient diagnoses, 
research, and treatment options by addressing one of the core issues: 
interoperability. By promoting standardized, reusable data, RareLink 
provides a foundation for advancements in rare disease care, facilitating a 
future where more patients can receive timely diagnoses and access to effective 
treatments.

   * - Name (Abbreviation)
     - Definition
   * - FAIR Data Principles
     - Designed to improve the automated discovery and usability of data by 
     machines while also facilitating its reuse by individuals (Findable, 
     Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). [Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792175/)
   * - Interoperability
     - The ability of different systems, applications, or devices to connect and
      communicate in a coordinated manner without requiring effort from the end 
      user. [Iroju, O., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516823/)
   * - Syntactic Interoperability
     - The ability of systems to communicate through compatible formats and 
     protocols, such as JSON files, a format for sharing data in key-value pairs
      and arrays, using human-readable text. [Iroju, O., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516823/)
   * - Semantic Interoperability
     - Ensures a shared and precise interpretation of medical data. Uniform data
      structuring and codification enhance machine-to-machine communication, 
      improving accuracy and outcomes.  [Iroju, O., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6516823/)
